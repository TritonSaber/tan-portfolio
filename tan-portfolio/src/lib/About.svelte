                    I am a Computer Science student at De La Salle University, Manila, majoring in Software Technology. I am looking for an internship 
                    where I can improve my skills in regards to not only programming, but also teamwork, and gain experience in a software development setting.
                    I do not have an exact specification, but I am open to any software development internship, but I am most interested in web development,
                    quality assurance, cloud computing, and database management (in that order).
                    <br><br>

                    Outside of school, I primarily enjoy playing video games, such as the Yakuza series. I also enjoy reading manga, and listening to music.
